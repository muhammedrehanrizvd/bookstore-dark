   Why I Built This
I love books, and I wanted to create a digital space that feels as inviting as walking into a cozy bookstore at night. This project helped me master:

Advanced React patterns
Responsive design with Tailwind
Form handling and validation
Clean, maintainable code structure
Creating delightful micro-interactions

It's not just a project — it's a tribute to reading and great design.
